## 仓库自诉
这是我第一次真正意义上使用互联网，并准备利用互联网做我一些想做的事情  
以前我只是一个浏览者，惊叹于互联网世界的奇妙；但现在我想做一名编辑者，去创造一些我喜欢的东西。
## 初入动机
我个人非常讨厌广告，但是在初步尝试了注册域名，构件服务器，编写代码等一系列操作之后，我发现，互联网完全没有想象中那么容易。他们完全有理由通过插入广告等手段谋取利益。

> 但是我仍然坚持通过优质内容让用户自愿付费（**用爱发电**）  

我知道也许这些看起来都很可笑，但是每个人都有那么一点纯真不是吗  
我是盗版游戏的受益者也许有的人听过fitgirl，我不是为盗版游戏正名，盗版就是盗版无可厚非。但是在动辄上百小时的流程，退款时间仅仅两小时之内，这完全是不合理的，虎头蛇尾的作品多了去了，再雪亮的眼睛也会被欺骗。我会在短暂体验盗版游戏后，决定是否购买，然后购买之后，继续享受我的盗版游戏。不用登陆，没有D加密给我的电脑造成负担，只是好好的享受游戏的乐趣。

所以我会尽量坚持内容为主，创造属于自己的互联网世界。 
## 关于内容
先学习吧，虽然当了很多年的浏览者，对于创作还是一片空白，也许我会先创建一个个人博客，用来练习和学习，同时在互联网拥有自己的一席之地。

尝试学点什么

## About the Repository
This is my first true use of the internet, and I'm prepared to utilize it for things I want to do. In the past, I was just a spectator, marveling at the wonders of the online world. But now, I aspire to be a creator, to craft things I love.

## Initial Motivation
I personally dislike advertisements, but after attempting domain registration, setting up servers, coding, and various other operations, I realized that the internet is not as easy as imagined. There are valid reasons for them to seek profit through methods like inserting ads.

> However, I persist in letting users voluntarily pay through quality content (powering by love).

I know this may seem a bit naive, but everyone has a bit of innocence, don't they? I am a beneficiary of pirated games, perhaps some have heard of FitGirl. I'm not endorsing piracy; piracy is piracy, no doubt. But with games that involve hundreds of hours, a refund window of just two hours is entirely unreasonable. There are many disappointing works out there, and even the keenest eyes can be deceived. After briefly experiencing a pirated game, I decide whether to purchase it and then continue to enjoy my pirated game. No login, no DRM burdening my computer, just pure enjoyment of the game.

So, I will strive to prioritize content, creating my own internet world.

## About Content
Let's start by learning. Although I've been a viewer for many years, I'm still a blank slate when it comes to creating. Perhaps I'll start by creating a personal blog to practice and learn, while having my own space on the internet.
